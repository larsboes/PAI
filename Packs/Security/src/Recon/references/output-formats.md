Reports saved to:
- **Work directory** (`~/.claude/MEMORY/WORK/{current_work}/`) - For iterative artifacts during investigation
- **MEMORY/RESEARCH/** (`~/.claude/MEMORY/RESEARCH/YYYY-MM/`) - For pentest engagements and formal assessments

## MCP Profile Requirements

**For passive recon:** No special MCP profile needed

**For active recon:** Requires security MCP profile
```bash
# Switch to security profile
~/.claude/MCPs/swap-mcp security

# Restart Claude Code to apply
# Then run active reconnaissance
```

Security profile includes:
- httpx (HTTP probing)
- naabu (port scanning)
- Other security tools

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **Authorization First** - Never perform active scanning without explicit authorization
2. **Scope Validation** - Ensure targets are in-scope for testing
3. **Rate Limiting** - Respectful scanning, no DoS or aggressive techniques
4. **Documentation** - Log all recon activities with timestamps and authorization
5. **Responsible Disclosure** - If vulnerabilities found, follow responsible disclosure
6. **No Destructive Testing** - Reconnaissance only, no exploitation

**Authorization Types:**
- Pentest engagement (written SOW/contract)
- Bug bounty program (in-scope targets only)
- Owned assets (your own infrastructure)
- Research lab/CTF environments

**Never scan:**
- Systems without permission
- Out-of-scope targets
- Critical infrastructure
- Government systems (without specific authorization)

**When in doubt:** Ask for explicit confirmation and documented authorization.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Passive Domain Recon
```
User: "Do passive recon on example.com"

Assistant: Activating recon skill with passive-recon workflow.
     Target: example.com
     Mode: Passive only (no active scanning)

     [Performs WHOIS, DNS, cert transparency, IPInfo]
     [Generates report in scratchpad]

     Report: ~/.claude/MEMORY/WORK/{current_work}/recon-example-com/
```

### Example 2: IP Investigation with Active Scan
```
User: "Investigate IP 1.2.3.4 - I own this server"

Assistant: Activating recon skill with ip-recon workflow.
     Target: 1.2.3.4

     Authorization check: You confirmed this is an owned asset.
     Proceeding with passive + active reconnaissance.

     [Performs IPInfo, reverse DNS, WHOIS, port scan, service detection]
     [Generates comprehensive report]

     Report: Open ports found (22, 80, 443)
             Services: SSH, HTTP, HTTPS
             Technologies: nginx 1.20.1, OpenSSH 8.2
```

### Example 3: Integration with OSINT
```
User: "Do OSINT on Acme Corp and map their infrastructure"

Assistant: Activating OSINT skill...
     Found domains: acme.com, acmecorp.com, acme.io

     Now calling recon for infrastructure mapping...

     [Recon skill maps each domain]
     [Discovers subdomains, IPs, netblocks]
     [Creates comprehensive infrastructure map]

     Report: Complete OSINT + Infrastructure report
             15 domains, 47 subdomains, 3 netblocks identified
```

## Workflow Selection Logic

**Automatic workflow selection based on input:**
- Input matches IP pattern (x.x.x.x) → `IpRecon.md`
- Input matches domain pattern → `DomainRecon.md`
- Input matches CIDR pattern (x.x.x.x/y) → `NetblockRecon.md`
- Input matches ASN pattern (AS####) → ASN investigation (inline using WHOIS/IPInfo/BGP data)
- User specifies "passive only" → `PassiveRecon.md`

**User can override:**
```
"Use passive-recon workflow on 1.2.3.4"
"Run domain-recon on example.com with active scanning"
```

## Success Criteria

**Passive Recon Success:**
- WHOIS data retrieved
- DNS records enumerated
- Certificate transparency searched
- IPInfo data gathered
- Structured report generated

**Active Recon Success:**
- Authorization confirmed and documented
- Passive recon completed first
- Port scan results (open/closed/filtered)
- Service detection performed
- Banner information gathered
- Technologies identified
- No errors or failures
- Respectful scan timing (no DoS)

**Remember:** Start passive, confirm authorization before going active, document everything, and be respectful of target systems.
