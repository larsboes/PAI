## Tier 1: playwright-cli (Primary Tool — Zero Tokens)

`playwright-cli` (`@playwright/cli`) provides named sessions, accessibility snapshots, and ref-based element interaction. This is the PRIMARY browser tool for all multi-step work.

### Session Lifecycle (CRITICAL)

Every `playwright-cli` session MUST follow this pattern:

```bash
# 1. OPEN a named session (--persistent keeps browser alive between commands)
playwright-cli -s=my-session open https://example.com --persistent

# 2. WORK — snapshot, click, fill, screenshot, etc.
playwright-cli -s=my-session snapshot
playwright-cli -s=my-session click e12
playwright-cli -s=my-session fill e15 "hello"
playwright-cli -s=my-session screenshot --filename=/tmp/shot.png

# 3. CLOSE — ALWAYS close when done. Non-negotiable.
playwright-cli -s=my-session close
```

**If you don't close your session, you leave a zombie browser process.**

### Core Commands

```bash
# Navigation
playwright-cli -s=<name> open <url> --persistent   # Open URL in named session
playwright-cli -s=<name> goto <url>                 # Navigate within session

# Inspection (zero tokens — machine-readable)
playwright-cli -s=<name> snapshot                   # Accessibility tree with refs
playwright-cli -s=<name> screenshot --filename=<path>  # Visual capture

# Interaction (use refs from snapshot)
playwright-cli -s=<name> click <ref>                # Click element by ref
playwright-cli -s=<name> fill <ref> "<value>"       # Fill input by ref
playwright-cli -s=<name> type "<text>"              # Type text (keyboard)
playwright-cli -s=<name> press <key>                # Press key (Enter, Tab, etc.)
playwright-cli -s=<name> select <ref> "<value>"     # Select dropdown option
playwright-cli -s=<name> hover <ref>                # Hover over element

# JavaScript
playwright-cli -s=<name> eval "<js>"                # Execute JavaScript

# Session management
playwright-cli -s=<name> close                      # ALWAYS close when done
```

### Ref-Based Interaction Pattern

The `snapshot` command returns an accessibility tree where every interactive element has a ref (e.g., `e12`, `e34`). Use these refs for reliable interaction:

```bash
# 1. Get the page structure
playwright-cli -s=login snapshot
# Output: heading "Login" [ref=e3], textbox "Email" [ref=e12], textbox "Password" [ref=e15], button "Sign In" [ref=e18]

# 2. Interact using refs
playwright-cli -s=login fill e12 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli -s=login fill e15 "password123"
playwright-cli -s=login click e18

# 3. Verify result
playwright-cli -s=login snapshot  # Check new page state
```

### Named Sessions for Parallelism

Each `-s=<name>` creates an isolated browser instance. Run multiple sessions simultaneously:

```bash
# Parallel: 3 independent browser sessions
playwright-cli -s=page-a open http://localhost:3000/page-a --persistent &
playwright-cli -s=page-b open http://localhost:3000/page-b --persistent &
playwright-cli -s=page-c open http://localhost:3000/page-c --persistent &
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_VIEWPORT_SIZE` | Set viewport: `1440x900` |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_HEADLESS` | Set to `false` for headed mode |

```bash
# Custom viewport
PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_VIEWPORT_SIZE=1440x900 playwright-cli -s=wide open https://example.com --persistent
```

## Tier 1b: bunx playwright (Quick One-Shot Commands)

For simple one-shot operations where you don't need a session:

```bash
# Screenshot a page (no session needed)
bunx playwright screenshot "https://example.com" /tmp/screenshot.png

# Screenshot with options
bunx playwright screenshot --browser chromium --full-page "https://example.com" /tmp/full.png

# Save as PDF
bunx playwright pdf "https://example.com" /tmp/page.pdf

# Wait for network idle before screenshot
bunx playwright screenshot --wait-for-timeout 3000 "https://example.com" /tmp/loaded.png
```

### Chrome Headless CLI

```bash
# Dump DOM (raw HTML)
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --headless=new --dump-dom "https://example.com"

# Screenshot
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --headless=new --screenshot=/tmp/chrome-shot.png "https://example.com"

# Print to PDF
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --headless=new --print-to-pdf=/tmp/page.pdf "https://example.com"
```

### Quick Checks

```bash
# Does the page load?
curl -sf "https://example.com" > /dev/null && echo "UP" || echo "DOWN"

# What status code?
curl -so /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://example.com"

# Page title extraction
curl -s "https://example.com" | grep -o '<title>[^<]*</title>'
```

### VERIFY Phase (CLI-First Pattern)

The mandatory verification loop for web development:

```
1. Make code change
2. Build
3. playwright-cli -s=verify open <url> --persistent
4. playwright-cli -s=verify screenshot --filename=/tmp/verify.png
5. Read /tmp/verify.png (visual inspection via Read tool)
6. If defect → fix → go to step 2
7. If clean → playwright-cli -s=verify close → report with screenshot evidence
```

**This replaces the old pattern of spawning a BrowserAgent for every verification.** BrowserAgent verification is only needed when you need the agent to check console errors, network requests, AND interact with the page — not for simple visual checks.

## Tier 2: BrowserAgent & UIReviewer (When AI Reasoning Is Needed)

For tasks requiring AI decision-making about what to do next. Both agents use `playwright-cli` internally.

**When to use BrowserAgent:**
- Complex flows where you need to inspect the page to decide the next action
- Combined check: screenshot + console errors + network requests + diagnosis
- Tasks requiring adaptive navigation (SPAs, dynamic content)

**When to use UIReviewer:**
- Structured user story validation with defined steps and assertions
- Parallel test execution (one UIReviewer per story)

**Agent definitions:** `~/.claude/agents/BrowserAgent.md` and `~/.claude/agents/UIReviewer.md`

**Usage:**

```
# Multi-step interaction needing AI reasoning (worth the 30K token cost)
Task(subagent_type="BrowserAgent", prompt="
  Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login.
  Type 'admin' into the username field.
  Type 'password' into the password field.
  Click 'Sign In'.
  Wait for the dashboard to load.
  Take a screenshot.
  Check console for errors.
  Report: screenshot path, any errors, dashboard content summary.
")

# Structured test validation
Task(subagent_type="UIReviewer", prompt="
  URL: http://localhost:3000.
  Steps: 1. Click 'Blog'. 2. Assert: blog listing visible. 3. Click first article. 4. Assert: article content visible.
")

# Parallel verification (8 pages at once)
Task(subagent_type="BrowserAgent", prompt="Check http://localhost:3000/page1")
Task(subagent_type="BrowserAgent", prompt="Check http://localhost:3000/page2")
```

## Tier 3: Headed Chrome (Authenticated Sessions)

For tasks requiring your logged-in browser state, extensions, or cookies.

**How it works:** Claude Code's `--chrome` flag connects to your actual Chrome browser. Single session, not parallelizable, but has access to all your cookies, sessions, and extensions.

**When to use:**
- Sites requiring login you can't easily replicate (SSO, 2FA)
- Tasks that need browser extensions (Claude extension, password managers)
- Shopping, booking, account management
- Any task where "use my Chrome" makes sense

**Usage:**
```bash
# Proper way: launch Claude Code with Chrome integration
claude --chrome
```

**Mid-session workaround** (when you need headed Chrome without restarting):
```bash
# Launch Chrome with remote debugging on your profile
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
  --user-data-dir="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome" \
  --profile-directory="Default" \
  --no-first-run \
  "<url>" &
```

**Limitations:**
- Single session only (bound to your physical browser)
- NOT parallelizable
- Visible browser window required
